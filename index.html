    <p>According to our German sources <blockquote cite="http://new.heimat.de/home/onlinekult/WebML/_html/MLp04.htm"> Below 2,400 feet, lava chambers pose a new danger to our mine vehicle. A powerful radiator can protect against the heat if one of the chambers is drilled into. These obstacles can also be removed with dynamite or plastic explosives.

        Emeralds can be found from 2,700 ft, and rubies from 3,200 ft.
